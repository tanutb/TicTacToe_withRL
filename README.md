# TicTacToe_withRL
 Solve Tic Tac Toe game using Reinforcement Learning. In current environment doesn't have a penalty for losing. make agent doesn't have enthusiastic for winning that much. However it's still playable.
#### Current Algorithm 
 - Q Learning
 - DoubleQ Learning
 - SARSA

# Running
Run to training and play using Qlearning 
```
python play.py -Agent $Algorithm
```
Useable Algorithm ```["SARSA" , "QLearning" , "DoubleQLearning"]```
At present, the parameters have been fixed.

# Evaluating
will add later
