# TicTacToe_withRL
Welcome to TicTacToe_withRL, a project focused on solving Tic Tac Toe using basic reinforcement learning algorithms. This project serves as a practical exercise for understanding reinforcement learning concepts, with implementations of various algorithms. While the code is functional, there might be areas for improvement or optimization.
#### Current Algorithm 
 - Q Learning
 - DoubleQ Learning
 - SARSA

# Running
To train and play using Q-learning, use the following command:
```
python play.py -a {Algorithm_name} -ep {Trainning_episode}
```
Replace {Algorithm_name} with one of the following: "SARSA", "QLearning", or "DoubleQLearning". The parameter {Training_episode} specifies the number of training episodes.
