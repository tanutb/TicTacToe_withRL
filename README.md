# TicTacToe_withRL
Solve Tic Tac Toe game implemented using basic reinforcement learning. This project is practice for understanding reinforcement algorithms. In some parts of the code may have inefficiencies or suboptimal writing.
#### Current Algorithm 
 - Q Learning
 - DoubleQ Learning
 - SARSA

# Running
Run to training and play using Qlearning 
```
python play.py -a {Algorithm_name} -ep {Trainning_episode}
```
Useable Algorithm ```["SARSA" , "QLearning" , "DoubleQLearning"]```
At present, the parameters have been fixed.

# Evaluating
will add later
